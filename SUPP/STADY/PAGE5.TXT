    My mother gave me 50 cents
    To see the elephant jump the fence,
    He jumped so high
    He reached the sky
    And didn't come down
    Till the forth of July.

    I am a pretty Dutch girl
    As pretty as I can be
    And all the boys in the neighbowhood
    Are crazy iover me
    My boy triend's name Mellow
    He comes from the land of ellow
    With pickles for his toes
    And a cherry for his nose
    And that's the way my story goes.

    Where are the cookies?
    I know I've put them in the cookey-jar
    Who stole the cookies from the cookey jar?
    Jimmy stole the cookies from the cookey jar?
    Who? Me? Yes, you!
    Not me! Then who?
    Linda stole the cookey from the cookeyJjar,
    Who? Me? Yes, you!
    Not me! Then who?

       ----------------------

 Have you ever, ever, ever in your long-legged life
 Seen a long-legged soilor
 And his long-legged wife?
 No I've never, never, never in my long-legged life
 Seen a long-legged sailor and his long-legged wife.

   To see what he could see, see, see
   But all that he could see see see
   Was the bottom of the deep blue sea sea sea
