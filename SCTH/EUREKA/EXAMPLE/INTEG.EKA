; This problem demonstrates how to use Eureka's built-in
; INTEG function to perform definite integrals.  The
; example comes from the study of income distributions.

; Income distribution function (Lorentz curve - non-ideal)
y(x) := (20/21)*x^2 + (1/21)*x

Num = integ((20/21)*x^2 + (1/21)*x, x, 0, 1)
Denom = integ(x,x,0,1)

; coefficient of inequality:
CoeffInEq = Num/Denom
