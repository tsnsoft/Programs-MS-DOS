ARCView  is a program for those who work with archive systems  to
economize  disk space.  You may work from the command line.   The
syntax  is simply
                    ARCView <file name>

or you may use ARCView under Norton Commander (TM) versions  2.0,
3.0 and 4.0 by pressing the <F3> key on a file name.

1.    The Main Features of ARCView

ARCView:

- allows you to view a content (list of files) of archived files
with the extensions  .ARC,  .PAK,  .ZIP, .LZH, .ICE, .CHZ, .ARJ,
.LIM,  .HA  and  .EXE.,  doing  this  without  having to use the 
original archive program,  and faster than the original archiver
could view it.

- allows  you  to  view  a  list  of  files  which   form   .SFX
(selfextracting)  archives;  this is an unattainable feature for
the archiver itself.  ARCView  recognizes over 40 different .SFX
formats.

- allows you to unpack,  view contents,  test,  and delete files
from archives.

- allows you to work with embedded  directories (subdirectories)
in archives.

- automatically  determines  the  type  of  archive.  If ARCView
determines it is not an archived  file,  it  will  activate  the
viewer  for  that  type  of file according to the file extension
name.  The  viewer  for  these  files  is  found  in  the   file
ARCVIEW.EXT.

- automatically  identifies  files in an archive which have been
packed using a password and marks them with the symbol "*", then
requests to enter the password.

- allows you to view commentaries in archives.

- supports EGA command lines (using <Alt-F9> under NC) and other
non-standard modes (e.g. 60 lines on the screen).

- recognizes multi-volume .ARJ - archives.

- offers additional convenient features.



The table below lists the names of the executable archive  files,
which ARCView uses for unpacking, viewing contents, file  testing
and  deletion in an archive.  The search for the archive  systems
occurs in the current directory and then follows the PATH setting
given in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

2. ARCView Installation

Installing ARCView is very simple.  Run the program  ARCINST.EXE.
Answer the questions the program asks you.  ARCView will  automa-
tically  find the Norton Commander and make a backup copy  of  it
under  the  name NCMAIN.OLD.  That way the old  configuration  is
saved if you wish to return to it by renaming the file again.

Warning:

You should not try to pack NC with programs of the  type  LZEXE,
DIET,  PKLITE, EXEPack and similar programs. For example, NC 4.0
is distributed packed by the program DIET 1.2.  (* This  is  the
way  NC  is  delivered in Russia,  it may not be packed when you
purchase it in Western countries).  Before installing  you  must
first unpack it with the command

DIET -RA NCMAIN.EXE

After  the correct version, size, and other internal  characteri-
stics of the Norton Commander have been verified by ARCView,  you
will be asked to select one of two methods to install ARCView.

The first method: ARCView replaces the viewer for Lotus1-2-3 (TM)
in  the  program NCMAIN.EXE with ARCView.  After  that  when  you
press  <F3> while the cursor is placed on one of the  files  with
one of the above listed extensions, you will be able to view  the
contents  of  the archived file.  Keep in mind that  ARCView  can
only  write six extensions under NC and ARCView cannot call  .CHZ
and .EXE files, which is connected with the peculiarities of NC.

The  second  method: ARCView is used as a dispatcher  of  various
viewers  contained in the module ARCVIEW.EXT analogous to the  NC
file  NC.EXT. When ARCView is loaded it automatically  loads  the
ARCVIEW.EXT  file into memory. When ARCView is asked to  view  an
archived  file  by pressing <F3> with the cursor on  the  desired
file  to be viewed, it looks for the necessary file extension  to
load  the correct viewer.  This second method has  one  drawback.
It  takes more memory.  If you pressed <F3> while the cursor  was
on  the the archived file TEST.CHI, the memory map  when  running
ARCView might look something like this:

NC.EXE         ( main kernel of NC           )
NCMAIN.EXE     ( NC not released from memory )
ARCVIEW.EXE    ( the program ARCView itself  )
CHIVIEW.EXE    ( the viewer for CHI-files    )

However, usually even only using a PC-AT (TM) with 80286 processor
with  1 MB of RAM under MS-DOS 5.0 (TM) taking advantage of  High
Memory,  all the viewers will be well placed and leave memory  in
reserve.  The amount of free memory is displayed in the right top
corner of the screen, for example:  "ÍÍÍ356KÍÍÍ".  If the capaci-
ty is less than 120-100 KB, you should release memory,  otherwise
you will not be able to run other programs from ARCView.

                    defined  F:\  as  your RAM disk).  While the
                    file is being unpacked ARCView checks to see
                    if  a  file  with  the  same name is present

           Packer - a program to delete files from an archive
         Unpacker - a program to unpack files
       Alt viewer - the alternate viewer loaded by pressing <Alt-F3>
        Temp path - the PATH which the unpacking files will follow
                    when <F3> and <Alt-F3> are pressed.
                    If you forget to set the environment variable,
                    then ARCView will search for the variable TEMP,
                    but if it does not find it, then it uses the
                    value from the initialization file ARCVIEW.INI.
     View comline - defines which parameters to use for extracting
                    one file from an archive without path by pressing <F3>
   Unpack comline - defines which parameters to use for extracting a
                    file or files from an archive, this is used for
                    the extract function by pressing <F4> or <Shift-f4>.
   Delete comline - defines which parameters to use for deleting a
                    file or files from an archive, this is used for
                    the delete function by pressing <F8>;
     Test comline - defines which parameters to use for testing a file
                    or files from an archive, this is used for the test
                    function by pressing <F9>.
      Add comline - defines which parameters to use for adding a file to
                    an archive, this is used for the Edit function <F5>.


4.   The Setup file ARCVIEW.EXT

     While viewing the contents of a file in an archive <F3>, ARC-
     View uses the extension file ARCVIEW.EXT.  This file may con-
     tain up to 40 lines: and its structure is completely analogous
     to the file structure of NC.EXT.

     The format of the ARCVIEW.EXT file:
                                 !.!  File name with extension
   txt: edit !\!.!               !:   Disk drive letter followed by a colon
   ^^^  ÀÄÄÄÂÄÄÄÄÙ               !\   Path name
    ³       ÀÄÄ DOS command      !!   !
    ÀÄÄ File extension           !    File name without extension

The main difference between the file ARCVIEW.EXT and NC.EXT consists
in the fact that the latter must have either ! or !.! after DOS
commands and ARCView doesn't need this.  If ARCView does not see the
line !.! or a similar line, it generates a command line completely
compatible to the one which NCMAIN passes on to its viewers. Besides
the file name the command line consists of about 15 parameters.

Here is an example of the way ARCVIEW.EXT might look:

arj: arcview.exe
au?: arcview.exe
al?: arcview.exe
lzh: arcview.exe
ice: arcview.exe
zip: arcview.exe
arc: arcview.exe
msg: msgview.exe !\!.!
chz: arcview.exe
exe: hiew.exe !\!.!
com: hiew.exe !\!.!
ovl: hiew.exe !\!.!
chi: chiview.exe !\!.!
pcx: pcxview.exe
fli: aaplay.exe !\!.!
db:  paraview.exe
123: 123view.exe
dbf: dbview.exe
gif: command.com /c av.bat
???: wpview.exe
