; This problem demonstrates how to solve a user-defined
; transcendental function of time.
; The problem is to calculate MassUnknown, the mass of
; 100 kg uranium 238 after one million years.

Mass(Years) := InitialMass * 2^(-Years/HalfLife)
InitialMass = 100
HalfLife = 10* 1e6
MassUnknown = Mass(1e6)
