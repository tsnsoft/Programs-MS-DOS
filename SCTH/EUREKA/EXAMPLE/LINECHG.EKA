; This example demonstrates Eureka's ability to solve
; a system of non-linear equations.  These equations
; represent the net force of each line charge in a
; system of 4 parallel, coplanar line charges aligned
; in an electric field.

1/(a-b) + 1/(a-c) + 1/a = 1

1/(b-a) + 1/(b-c) + 1/b = 1

1/(c-a) + 1/(c-b) + 1/c = 1
