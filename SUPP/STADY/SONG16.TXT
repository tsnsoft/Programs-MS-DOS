    When I reached my house at seven,     Bob was sleeping under the tabl
    Max was playing the guitar.           he couldn' t even stay awake.
    Jane was sitting on the table         And my dog was in the kitchen
    eating pickles from a jar.            eating up the birthday cake.


    Mark was sitting at the piano
    playing sonatas for Louise,
    and my parrot Paul was singing
    all the tunes and melodies.
