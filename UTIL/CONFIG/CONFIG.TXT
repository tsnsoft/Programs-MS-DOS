  Brief Description:
  ==================
  PC-CONFIG is principally a program which can list the componenets of
  your computer without you having to touch a single screw to look 
  inside

  While there are several of this kind of program (let's call them 
  computer test or diagnostic programs) available on the international 
  commercial market, you will certainly want to put PC-CONFIG on the 
  short list.

  The main users of PC-CONFIG are professionionals and interested 
  amateurs, who like to be informed over the hardware configuration
  of their computers, be it because they wish to make sure a computer 
  really has what it claims to have before buying it, or because they 
  change the hardware of their computers often and wish to confirm that 
  everything runs properly together.


  The Window HARDWARE:
  ====================
  Machine:
   At this point the computer BIOS is searched for possible clues as to
   the computer manufacturer (e.g. Commodore, Unitron....) and the
   computer is gererally classified (XT,AT,AT386). At the same time,
   particular chip-sets are tested for:- Chips & Technologies, G2-, OPTI,
   SIS, UMC, FOREX, ETEQ, ELITE, CONTAC, SHASTA (see also below: problems)

  BIOS:
   The copyright string found in the BIOS is displayed here. It may be
   that the BIOS copyright does not belong to the computer manufacturer.
   This is because many manufacturers use licensed versions of a BIOS.
   In this way, a Unitron computer for example has a Phoenix BIOS.

  BIOS-Date:
   This  shows how  old the  BIOS-version is,  und thus the age  of the
   computer. Also checked is whether the BIOS (in computers built since
   1987)  is copied into shadow RAM.  If BIOS calls run as quickly as
   normal RAM calls, it can be assumed that the BIOS has been copied 
   into RAM.

   In the case of a 386er, shadow RAM is assumed if the call is 32 bits
   wide.

  BIOS-Extension:
   The address of any BIOS extension such as VGA-ROM or SCSI controller ROM
   is displayed

  Bus System:
   Displays whether the computer has a standard ISA (= Industry Standard
   Architecture) bus, an EISA (=extended ISA) bus, IBM's Microchannel
   Architecture (MCA), the popular VESA-Local-Bus, or Intels PCI Bus.

  Processor:
   The CPU is identified (88,86,188,186,286,386DX/SX,486DX/SX,Pentium, 
   Cyrix486, RapidCAD,V20,V30). 80386 or 80486 processors are tested 
   whether they are running in REAL or VIRTUAL mode (many memory 
   managers such as 386MAX run the processor in virtual mode). The 
   processor clock speed is displayed, together with the number of wait 
   states on a memory access (8 and 16 bit CPUs only).

  RAM-Access:
   Tested here is whether the computer accesses memory:-
   a) in normal mode
   b) in Page-Mode, that is within a small page fast and outside a page 
      slower (with waitstates). This makes possible the use of slower, 
      cheaper RAMs at high clock frequencies.
   c) through a processor cache (80386 & 80486 only)
   Tries to destinguish between frist and second level cache of the cpu.

  Main Memory:
   Total amount of memory and amount of free memory.

  Extended Mem:
   Memory above 1 MB (only on ATs). The amount of extended memory
   still free is obtained from a XMS driver if used, otherwise through 
   Int 15h.

  Expanded Mem:
   Expanded memory to LIM specification (in XTs oder ATs). This sort of
   memory extension can be used by many programs, and for this reason
   most memory managers for 386 computers change extended memory through
   software into expanded memory.

   In this case the amount of expanded memory is contained within the
   amount of extended memory.

  Graphics card 1:
   CGA, MGA, Hercules, EGA, and VGA video adapters are recognised.
   The BIOS of EGA and VGA cards are searched as above for a possible 
   manufacturer's identity. VGA cards are tested, whether they allow 8 
   or 16 bit access. This is normally immediately reflected in the speed
   of the card. Thus even in the fastest IBM PS/2 models, the maximum 
   video throughput is only 500kB/s, because of the 8 bit bus. A 16 bit 
   bus card with a Tseng ET4000 chip reaches a throughput of over 
   2000kB/s.

  VGA Chip-set:
   CONFIG attempts to identify the chip-set of any Super VGA card
   which may be present. The following chip-sets can be recognised:-
   ATI, NCR, Trident, Video 7, Genoa, Paradise, Chips & Technologies, Above,
   OAK Technology, Tseng, ZyMOS, Cirrus, Ahead, Yamaha, S3.

  EGA/VGA-BIOS:
   Any further available information about the BIOS of the installed
   graphics card will be displayed here (only for ATI, TRIDENT, AHEAD,
   TSENG, GEMINI und some OAK cards).

  Graphics card 2:
   If an additional monochrome graphics card should be present, this will
   be displayed here

  NPU:
   Intel 8087, 80287, 80387, IIT 80287, 80387 and software coprocessor
   emulators can be identified.

  Game card:
   CONFIG will attempt to identify any Joystick port which is present.
   Unfortunately the identification for game cards is not standardised
   and other computer test programs may come to different conclusions.
   Generally it can be assumed, if CONFIG says a game port is present,
   then one is definitely present. If CONFIG says no game port is
   present, then "probably" none is present.

  Floppy drives:
   The number and the type of floppy drives present.

  IO Ports:
   The number of parallel and serial ports installed.


  The Window HARDWARE 2:           (registered version only)
  ======================
  Here is checked whether the main BIOS can support an extended keyboard
  (i.e. with the extra F11 and F12 function keys), and whether such a
  keyboard is connected

  UART-Chips:
   Here is shown which type of chip is installed on the serial interface
   (8250, 16450, 16550, 16550A, 16552), and the current port settings.

  SCSI-Controller:
   The manufacturer of any installed SCSI adapter is shown, together with
   the start address for the controller ROM

  Modem connected:
   Whether a Hayes-compatible Modem is connected, and if so on which 
   port. Some modems can only be recognised immediately after 
   initialisation. If required, the switch INITMODEM in the CONFIG.INI 
   should be set to ON

  Sound Cards:
   Soundblaster, Adlib and Roland cards are searched for. Should this
   test collide with other hardware (Network adaptors for example), it 
   can be disabled in the CONFIG.INI. Soundboards with AZTECH chipset
   are recognized.

  CD-ROM:
   Whether a CD-ROM drive is connected, and which version of the driver 
   is in use.

  IDE Harddisks:
   If present, the name, cache size and controller version of an IDE
   harddisk will be displayed.
   This test can however lead to problems with other types (non-IDE)
   of controller. In this case the switch ATBUSINFO should be set to OFF


  The Window SOFTWARE:
  ====================
  DOS-Version:
   The current DOS version is displayed. Novell DOS should be recognised.
   In most cases the language version should also be displayed (english,
   german or french). For DOS 5 will be noted whether it is currently
   loaded into the HMA (high memory area). If DOS has been started from
   an OS/2 DOS-Box, this will also be recognised.

  Networks:
   Is an MS-NetBIOS compatible network installed? In this case the
   network name for the computer will be displayed. Novell networks
   will be recognised.

  Mouse present:
   Microsoft, Genius, Logitech, Agiler, Reis-Ware, Unitron, und Truedox
   Mouse drivers can be recognised.
   Many mouse suppliers these days try to achieve a very high
   compatibility to the Microsoft original, so their drivers may be
   recognised as Microsoft.
   Note: If a program which changes the mouse interrupt has been loaded
   after the mouse driver (e.g. a screen saver), the mouse driver cannot
   be recognised.

  Mouse Type:
   If the mouse driver supports the function 36, the type (serial, bus,
   inport, HP-mouse) of mouse and the driver version number can be
   displayed

  EMS Driver:
   The type of EMS supported by the driver, and if possible the supplier
   name (e.g. Compaq, Toshiba...) and the pageframe address.

  XMS Driver:
   The XMS version supported by the driver, and the internal version
   number of the driver.

  DPMI Server:
   The versionnumber of the 'DOS Protected Mode Interface', an additional
   extended memory standard.

  DPMS Server:
   The versionnumber of Novell's 'DOS Protected Mode Services', yet
   another extended memory standard.

  Sofware Disk-Cache:
   The following can be recognised:
   Norton-Cache (V5 & V6), Smartdrive, IBMCACHE, Compaq-Cache, QCACHE,
   HyperCache, PC-Cache, NWCache.
   If problems should occur, the test for these programs can be disabled
   with the switch SkipHDCacheTest in the .INI file.

  Fossil-Driver:
   This is a software extension of the BIOS for the serial port.
   A driver of this kind can be essential for the use of a high speed
   modem and the software which is used with it.

  4DOS:
   4DOS, the shareware replacement for COMMAND.COM, and its version
   number will be identified if loaded, as will those for NDOS, a version
   from Peter Norton.

  RAM-Disk:
   The following RAM disk types can be recognised:
   VDISK (PC-DOS und DR-DOS), RAMDRIVE (MS-DOS), 386DISK (386MAX),
   XPANDISK, NJRAM-Disk, SRDisk, xDISK, TurboDisk

  Memory-Manager:
   The following can be recognised:
   Windows, DesqView, 386MAX, QEMM386, Move'em, EMM386


  The Window BENCHMARK:
  =====================
  Speed relative to IBM-PC:
   The CPU speed relative to the IBM-PC is measured with a loop made up
   of frequent machine instructions such as AND, MOV, NOT, SHR, and
   accessing different memory segments. This value depends directly on in
   the CPU type, clock speed and waitstates, and is useful as a measure
   of pure processing speed. The loop is small, and will fit completely
   in a CPU-cache, if present. The real meaning of such a value is
   therefore debatable.

  Dhrystones & Whetstones:
   These are well known benchmark test from the Unix world, and the 
   versions here are implemented in Pascal. The results from the pascal 
   and C versions are compiler-dependent and not necessarily directly 
   comparable. The larger the resulting value the better. The test 
   routines fit completely into an 8 kB CPU-cache. Dhrystones gives a 
   measure of the integer processing power of the CPU, Whetstones 
   measures the performance of the Math Co-Processor. Both test were 
   changed frequently in the 70's and 80's and there are versions in
   many programming languages. The pascal versions used here are the 
   same ones used by Norman Juffa in his test program CTEST257. The 
   results are not however comparable with CTEST257, because Juffa used 
   his own run-time library for his program.

  VideoRAM-Throughput, Scroll, VideoWaits:
   The Video RAM throughput describes roughly how many characters can be
   written directly to the screen. This value, and the time taken to
   scroll the screen 1 line up, depends mostly on the speed of the video
   adapter, but partly also on the processor speed. The number of
   Video-Waits is also dependent on the CPU speed, but serves mostly as a
   basis for comparison with other video cards. It is not to be taken as
   an absolute value. With a VGA card for example, very different values
   will be measured depending on the selected video mode. As a general 
   rule though, the fewer waits, the faster the card!

  EMS-Speed:
   The time measured here is that to blend in 1 (!) EMS page in the page
   frame. The measured value is compared with the time that this task
   would take on a 16MHz NEAT computer (100%). Other types of hardware
   EMS reach values around 90-110%, 386 software EMS (e.g. 386MAX) come
   in at around 70%, and 286 EMS emulators about 2%-5%.

  RAM Disk Speed:
   A file is opened, written to the RAM Disk for 1 second, closed,
   reread, deleted and so on repeatedly.
   From this the throughput capability of the RAM disk is calculated.
   Run your RAM Disk first in Extended Memory then in Expanded Memory, 
   and see the difference!

   The drive letter for the RAM Disk will be automatically recognised if
   possible, but can be specified in the .INI file if necessary.

  DOS-Disk-Speed:
   Here, a file is opened, written for 4 seconds to the disk, closed,
   reread, deleted and so on repeatedly.
   From this the throughput capability of this DOS Disk is calculated.
   The effect of caches can clearly be seen here.
   The drive to be tested can be specified in the .INI file! If no drive is
   specified here, the current drive will be tested.

  Harddisk Tests:
   The harddisk throughput is established by means of time taken to carry
   out absolute write-accesses through the BIOS routines. This test must
   be done without any cache active, because the measured speed and the
   interleave factor calculation from it will be heavily distorted by an
   active cache. CONFIG will therefore not do this test, if it finds that
   a cache is indeed active. The test can be forced in spite of this with
   the entry FORCEHDTEST=YES in the .INI file.

   In the same way, the rotational speed of the harddisk can only be
   established, so long as no cache software is active, AND the harddisk
   has no hardware cache bigger than 32KB of its own.

   The average access time is decided from 100 random head positionings
   over the whole disk surface, and can vary from test to test by up to 5ms.
   The test can be skipped by pressing the SHIFT or CAPS-LOCK key.


  The Window Mem-Timing:
  ======================
   Displayed here is the access speed for the different areas of memory.
   The speed of access to the main memory (first 640k) is defined as 1.0.
   It can now be compared, for example, how quick the access is to, say, the
   VGA BIOS at C000h, perhaps with factor 2.3. That means that accesses
   here need 2.3 times as long as main memory access.
   In addition, the throughput speed of the CPU cache memory (if present)
   and of the main memory will be measured. The value is given in
   kByte/sec. The quality of the CPU cache can ssen here, as can the
   effect of wait states on main memory access.
   For comparison, values for a 386/40 Forex-Chipsatz:
   Cache: 38000 KB, Mem: 22000 KB

  The Window VGA-Timing:          (registered version only!)
  ======================
   The most significant text and graphic modi are activated, and the
   picture frame rate measured. At each mode switch, the PC loudspeaker
   should click. The test lasts 30 seconds. Standard VGA cards run in
   text mode at 70Hz and in graphics mode at 60Hz. At 60Hz with a light
   picture background a slight flickering of the screen is probably
   noticeable. Modern graphics cards can manage 70Hz even in graphics
   mode, or are even freely configurable for each mode.
   It can happen that the computer crashes here because there very many
   different graphics adaptors and a mode on one does not always match
   exactly a mode on another. For this reason the number of modes tested
   can be limited by an entry in the .INI file.


  Demo-Mode and Auto-Log / Commercial Version:
  ============================================
   Of interest to dealers is the DEMO-MODE, by which CONFIG can be set to
   run for a predetermined time repeatedly through the displays HARDWARE,
   HARDWARE2, SOFTWARE, BENCHMARK, COMPARE and INFO.
   Optionally a list of your own values can be displayed for comparative
   testing.

   This is ideal for a showcase or shop window demonstration.

   The DEMO mode can be activated either with an entry in the .INI file
   or from a running CONFIG by pressing the "D" key. The length of time
   the demo should run can also be entered in the .INI file

   When testing computers it is often desirable to produce a hard copy of
   all important screen displays. If the switch AUTOLOG in the .INI file
   is set to YES, then all displays defined in the switch
   LOG(PROTOKOLL) will be copied automatically into the file CONFIG.XXX
   The following screens may be logged:
   Hardware 1&2, Software, Benchmark, Chips, Mem-Timing, VGA-Timing,
   Drivers, IRQs, Notes.

   Logging can also be started independently from the .INI file with a
   command line parameter. Simply start CONFIG with the parameter p,
   followed by the the desired windows (see example), and the appropriate
   data will be logged in the file CONFIG.XXX.

   For example CONFIG phsm: p is for Protokoll (log) and the hsm for
   windows (h)ardware, (s)oftware, and (m)em-timing.

   If the log should be put somewhere other than the file CONFIG.XXX,
   this can be given as a second parameter, for example:

    CONFIG phsm prn

    and the log will be output immediately to the printer.

   Demo mode and Autolog are only available in the commercial version,
   and run only when a further key is entered into the .REG file.

   This feature can be ordered for DM 100,- at any time.


  Limitations:
  ============
  -under Windows in 386 mode and other multitasking environments,
   it is not possible to make short term time measurements, which makes
   benchmark tests and the like impossible.
  -under DR-DOS 6.0 EMM386, the speed measurement test for extended 
   memory causes privilege errors. The switch TESTEXTMEM must therefore 
   be set to NO(NEIN)
  -PC-Cache V5.x is recognised as Multisoft QCache
  -There are problems with more than ONE continuous area HI-DOS
  -Some computers slow down their clock frequency when a floppy drive is 
   running. CONFIG can usually recognise when it has been started from a 
   floppy and waits for the drive to come to rest. However with some 
   Compaq computers this recognition does not work, and for this reason 
   the displayed value for the clock speed is wrong. In this case press
   "R" for Restart!
  -If ALL resident software is loaded in HI-DOS, this causes problems.
  -CONFIG cannot find RAMdisks loaded high under QEMM.
  -The amount of memory on a VGA card can sometimes only be properly
   identified if the monitor connected can also display the higher
   definitions.
  -No waitstates are measured with 386 processsors, because the procedure
   used here only gives correct values with 8 and 16 bit computers.
   (The discussion about wait states is a moot point anyway, because it 
    is the real computing speed reached which is actually of interest.)
  -On some computers (e.g. IBM XT/286) there are problems with
   establishing the harddisk access times.


  What to do in case of problems:
  ===============================
  CONFIG is programmed at low level, close to hardware. For this reason, 
  crashes must be reckoned with. Recognition of the Chip-Set on the main 
  board is sometimes problematical. This test can be skipped by pressing 
  the SCROLL-LOCK key, or by setting the switch TESTBOARD in the 
  CONFIG.INI file. Should CONFIG still crash before the windows appear 
  on the screen, start CONFIG with the command line parameter "log". In 
  this case a file CONFIG.LOG will be opened on the current drive, in 
  which all the tests will be logged. The last test logged is then the 
  one causing the crash. It may be possible to skip this problem area 
  with an appropriate entry in the .INI file.

  If you should discover bugs in the program, or other problems, please
  store the current screen contents in a file by pressing F10, and send me
  this file together with your comments AND your version number of CONFIG
  AND the date of your CONFIG.EXE file. I will then try to fix the
  problem.


  Errors in 80386-Processors:
  ===========================
  To my knowledge, INTEL overlooked at least four errors (bugs) in the
  production of the 80386 processor:

  1) Early versions could not switch back to the protected mode from the
     real mode
  2) Early versions did not carry out 32 bit multiplication properly.
  3) Early versions incremented the EDI Register after a STOSB instruction
     incorrectly from 0000FFFFh to 00000000h, instead of to 00010000h!
  4) The POPAD instruction did not restore the EAX register correctly
     under certain conditions.

  Whereas the bugs 1-3 were very soon corrected (they only apply to
  16 MHz versions anyway), bug 4 was only discovered around the middle
  of 1990, and nearly all versions of the 386DX and 386SX from Intel and 
  AMD to date (Jan 91) still have the error. The very newest versions, 
  at least from Intel, have been corrected. The bug is however now well 
  known to programmers and the instruction used with appropriate 
  caution.

  CONFIG tests for the bugs 2-4.
