INSTALLING FOXPRO FOR MS-DOS

Three installation options are available with FoxPro for MS-DOS:

 *  Normal Installation copies the FoxPro program files, help files
    and examples from disk or from a network to your hard drive.
    Normal Installation installs FoxPro for MS-DOS on a single
    machine.

 *  Administrative Installation ( /A) copies all FoxPro files along
    with installation files to a network drive so that users can
    either run the shared network copy after doing a Workstation
    Installation or install FoxPro for MS-DOS to their local machines
    with a Normal Installation.

 *  Workstation Installation ( /N) copies FoxPro initialization files
    to a local machine so that a shared network version of FoxPro for
    MS-DOS can be run.  Workstation Installation requires less space
    on individual machines and allows greater administrative control
    of the use of FoxPro.  Workstation Installation requires a
    previous Administrative Installation.
    
 *  Normal Installation After an Administrative Installation works the
    same way Normal Installation from floppy disks works.  The way you
    initiate Normal Installation after an Administrative Installation
    is by typing X:\<path>\INSTALL at the MS-DOS prompt and pressing
    Enter.  X represents the network drive and <path> represents the
    directory in which FoxPro was installed with the Administrative
    Installation option.

	* Note:  Every Microsoft FoxPro user must have a Microsoft   *
	* FoxPro license.  A license is obtained by buying a retail  *
	* package or a Microsoft License Pack.  For more information * 
	* about network use restrictions, see your Microsoft FoxPro  *
	* license agreement.                                         *
	**************************************************************

	For information about Normal Installation, see the FoxPro for
	MS-DOS Installation and Configuration manual.
	
	FoxPro asks you several questions during the installation process. 
	The default response is listed in brackets, for example:
	
	Is this information correct? [Y] :

	To choose the default response, press Enter.

	These instructions assume that you are installing from drive A. 
	If you are installing from another drive, please adjust the
	instructions accordingly.
	

ADMINISTRATIVE INSTALLATION ( /A)
 
	Before you start the Administrative Installation, the network must
	be operational and you must have read and write access to the
	network	directory in which you want to install FoxPro.  For more
	information, see your network software documentation.
	
	To install FoxPro for MS-DOS for administrative use:
	
	1.  Insert FoxPro Disk 1 into drive A.

	2.  Type A:\INSTALL /A at the MS-DOS prompt and press Enter.

	3.  Enter your name and company in the spaces provided.  You will
	be asked to confirm this information.  If you re-install FoxPro,
	this information will automatically be included.  When you start
	FoxPro for MS-DOS, this information will appear on the
	initialization screen.

	4.  The installation program suggests a directory in which to
	install FoxPro for MS-DOS.  To confirm that you want to install
	FoxPro in this directory, press Enter.  If you do not want to
	install FoxPro in the default directory, type N and press Enter. 
	You will be prompted for an installation directory.
	
	5.  If the directory in which FoxPro will be installed is not in
	your path, the installation program asks you whether or not you
	want your path changed in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  Press Enter to
	allow the modification, or type N and press Enter if you do not
	want your path modified.

	6.  The required FoxPro for MS-DOS files and all files necessary
	for subsequent installations are copied to the server.  When the
	basic installation is completed, you are prompted to press Escape
	to quit or any other key to continue with optional component
	installation.

Optional Component Installation

	The optional components you choose to install in the
	Administrative Installation are available for workstation use;
	those components you do not install are not available.  All FoxPro
	components remain available to those who perform Normal
	Installations after the Administrative Installation, regardless of
	which optional components you include.
		
	Before installing optional components, the installation program
	prompts you to choose the type of monitor used with your system.

	Use the arrow keys to highlight the appropriate monitor type and
	press Enter.

	During installation, you are given the option of installing the
	FoxPro supplemental programs and files.  This step is identical to
	the corresponding step in Normal Installation.  For more
	information, refer to the FoxPro for MS-DOS Installation and
	Configuration manual.

Stopping the Installation

	If you want to stop the installation process, you can press Escape
	at any prompt or press Ctrl+C at any time.  Note that if you press
	Ctrl+C, installation does not stop immediately.  When it does, the
	MS-DOS prompt appears.

Installing Additional Files

	After you have installed FoxPro, you can install any optional
	components that you did not specify during installation.  To do
	so, restart FoxPro by typing FOX at the MS-DOS prompt and pressing
	Enter.  Insert any one of the product disks into the floppy drive
	and enter the following command in FoxPro's Command window:

	DO INSTALL

	You will be prompted to insert the disk or disks that contain the
	additional files that you want to install.

	Note: If you are installing from a drive other than A:, you will
	be instructed to select another source drive after the "Abort,
	Retry, Fail?" message.  


WORKSTATION INSTALLATION ( /N)

	1.  Type X:\<path>\INSTALL /N at the MS-DOS prompt. X represents
	the network drive and <path> represents the directory in which
	FoxPro was installed with the Administrative Installation option.    

	2.  The installation program suggests a directory in which to
	install FoxPro.  To confirm that you want to install FoxPro in
	this directory, press Enter.  If you do not want to install FoxPro
	in the default directory, type N and press Enter.  You will be
	prompted for an installation directory.

	3.  If the directory in which FoxPro will be installed is not in
	your path, the installation program asks you whether or not you
	want your path changed in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  Press Enter to
	allow the modification, or type N and press Enter if you do not
	want your path modified.

	4.  FOX.EXE is copied to your FoxPro directory.  You can end the
	installation by pressing Escape at this point or press any other
	key to configure your FoxPro workstation.

	5.  An information screen explains FoxPro configuration and allows
	you to specify the directory for your configuration files to be
	created in.  The default is your FoxPro directory.  Press Enter to
	accept this default or type your preferred directory in the text
	box and press Enter.

	6.  Choose <<Continue with configuration>> to proceed or <Abort
	configuration procedure> to cancel the configuration procedure.

	7.  A dialog opens so that you can set the directories for:
	
	  * CONFIG.FP - Your FoxPro configuration file.
	  * FOXUSER - A FoxPro database that keeps track of window sizes
	  and so on.
	  * Overlay files - Since the FoxPro executable file is too large
	  to fit in conventional memory at one time, parts of	             
	  it are kept in overlay files and loaded into memory	             
	  as needed.
	  * Editor work files - Temporary files created during editing
	  sessions.
	  * Sort work files - Temporary files used during database sorting
	  and indexing.
	  * Program work file - Temporary program file.
  
	Descriptions of these options are included in the dialog.  By
	default, FoxPro uses all available expanded memory. In this
	dialog, you are given the option to Limit EMS Available to FoxPro. 
	There are three push buttons at the bottom of the dialog:
		<<OK>> - Accept the directories and EMS settings.
		<filer> - Open the FoxPro Filer accessory to view your
		directories before deciding on configuration directory
		defaults.
		<Cancel> - Cancel the configuration procedure.

	8. You are given the option to have FoxPro update your
	AUTOEXEC.BAT file so that FoxPro looks for configuration
	information in the directories that you have specified.
	
	9. You are given the option to have configuration changes written
	to your CONFIG.FP file.

	10.  Installation is complete.  Press any key to start FoxPro. 
	Remember to reboot your machine so that changes made to your
	AUTOEXEC.BAT can take effect.
