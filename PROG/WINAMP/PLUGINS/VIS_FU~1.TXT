                   Funky FX Plugin for WinAmp
                             v1.00
                   --------------------------

                          22 Sep 1998

Inroduction
-----------

This archive contains the FunkyFX Plug-In for WinAmp. Version 1.00
improves quite considerably on the previous versions (0,99, 0.9b, 0.01),
adding support for a wide variety of fullscreen modes, and most importantly,
skins. v1.00 also debuts the FrequencywurX module.

The FyrewurX module displays some nice fireworks in time to whatever music 
WinAmp is currently playing. Since version 0.9b you've been able to configure
the way the fireworks look and feel.

The FrequencywurX module displays a nice spectrum analyzer that can be
configured to you tastes.

The first release of the plugin was based on source code I obtained from
the NolrS Speakers (vis_spk.dll) by Alex Black. 
You can try looking at http://www.eng.uwaterloo.ca/students/speakers/ for 
more information.

Since version 0.99 almost all of the code has been rewritten, so any bugs
in this plugin are without doubt due to me however.

Disclaimer
----------

This software comes with no warranty - use it at your own risk (or as Sun
Microsystems would say):

"THIS SOFTWARE IS NOT DESIGNED OR INTENDED FOR USE OR RESALE AS ON-LINE
CONTROL EQUIPMENT IN HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENTS REQUIRING FAIL-SAFE
PERFORMANCE, SUCH AS IN THE OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT
NAVIGATION OR COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, DIRECT LIFE
SUPPORT MACHINES, OR WEAPONS SYSTEMS, IN WHICH THE FAILURE OF THE SOFTWARE 
COULD LEAD DIRECTLY TO DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, OR SEVERE PHYSICAL OR 
ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE ("HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES")."

So don't try and use it to control atomic toasters or anything.

Requirements
------------

This plugin should work with most hardware / software. Obviously it won't 
look particularly exciting on a 486, but a mid to high end Pentium should 
be fine. I've tested the plugin on PII machines (an Intel P-II 266, and a
AMD K6-2 300), an Intel P-90 and and AMD K6-200.

Oh, and as of version 0.99 you'll need DirectX installed (any version will
do - see http://www.microsoft.com/directx/)


Installation
------------

Extract the archive into your WinAmp plugins directory (usually C:\Program 
Files\WinAmp\Plugins\). If all goes to plan, the following files should be
installed (if you're using WinZip, make sure that "Use Folder Names" is
turned on and this will be done automatically):

vis_funkyfx.dll (in C:\Program Files\WinAmp\Plugins\)

vis_funkyfx.txt (this file) (in C:\Program Files\WinAmp\Plugins\)

Numerous .ffx settings files (in C:\Program Files\WinAmp\Plugins\FrequencywurX\
and C:\Program Files\WinAmp\Plugins\FyrewurX\)

The default WinAmp.ffs skin file (and bitmap WinAmp.bmp)
(in C:\Program Files\WinAmp\Plugins\FFXSkins\)

When you install other skins for FunkyFX, you should install them in
FFXSkins/. You should try to keep preset (.ffx) files in the correct directory
(e.g. FrequencywurX/ or FyrewurX/)

Configuration
-------------

There are various options that you can fiddle with to get the plugin 
working more to your taste or just to speed it up by right clicking on
its display  - take a look at the website for more detailed information:

Skins
-----

The biggest feature of FunkyFX v1.00 is the option to use skins.
At the moment, this plugin only comes with the default WinAmp skin.
If you want to download more skins (or find out how to create your
own), please visit:

Known Bugs
----------

I've tested this plugin with both WinAmp 2 and WinAmp 1.92. Under Version
2 of WinAmp, it sometimes crashes when you come out of fullscreen mode.
As this has also happened with other plugins under WinAmp 2, I'm not sure
if it's this plugin's fault or not.

In Windows 98, the plugin sometimes seems to leave "dead" windows on the
taskbar when you change from fullscreen to windowed modes. You can click
on these windows to remove them, so there's no real harm done.

NOTE: Further investigation suggests that this is a problem with Win98
rather than with the plugin.

Please report any obvious bugs to paulh@javigate.com

Source Code
-----------

I'll be releasing the source code for the window handling (and Skinning)
code sometime soon. If you're interested, please take a look at
