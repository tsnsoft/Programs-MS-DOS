StyxVis is a Windowed/FullScreen WinAmp plug-in.
It has been tested with WinAmp 1.90 and above (up to 1.92).

To change the many options right click on the plug-in window.
There are a couple of built-in key combinations.

- ALT+ENTER     Toggles FullScreen/Windowed Mode
- ALT+PGUP      Switch to the previous configuration
- ALT+PGDOWN    Switch to the next configuration

The available options are many which allows you to really customize
this plug-in to suit you taste.  Since there are so many options,
your favorite configurations can be saved in the configuration
manager.  Some sample configurations are included by the development
team and the BETA testers.

Available options:

Blur
----
Blurring is the main feature of StyxVis.  It can be used to produce
fire like effects or just general blurring.

Blur Speed
----------
This allows control over how fast the blur fades.  There are four
settings from Normal (the slowest) to Super Fast.

Color Scheme
-------------
There are four predefined color schemes but most users will want to
pick a custom color scheme by selecting Customize.

Correction
----------
The raw data from WinAmp is a little non-exciting.  Correction allows
you to change the scale at which the data is displayed.

Position
--------
The display can be moved to the top, middle or bottom of the window.

Maximums
--------
This setting controls the rate of decay for the maximums (the little
dots which are pushed up by the lines and fall away).

Song Name
---------
The current song name can be displayed at various locations in the
window.

Scope
-----
The scopes show the left and right channels as a function of time.

Track WinAmp
------------
Allows the window to be set so that when WinAmp is moved StyxVis
will follow right along.

Resolution
----------
There are three resolution levels, which control the "chunkyness" of
the display.

Clear Screen
------------
Clears the display

Full Screen
-----------
Changes StyxVis to full screen.  Note, FullScreen depends upon DirectX
being installed.  The visualize works with Win95/Win98 and WinNT (SP3).

Configurations
--------------
Allows configurations to be saved and loaded and even renamed.

-----
