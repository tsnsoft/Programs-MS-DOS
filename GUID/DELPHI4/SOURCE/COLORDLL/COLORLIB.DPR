{ Important note about DLL memory management: ShareMem must be
  the first unit in your library's USES clause AND your
  project's (select View-Project Source) USES clause if your
  DLL exports any procedures or functions that pass strings as
  parameters or function results. This applies to all strings
  passed to and from your DLL--even those that are nested in
  records and classes. ShareMem is the interface unit to the
  DELPHIMM.DLL shared memory manager, which must be deployed
  along with your DLL. To avoid using DELPHIMM.DLL, pass string
  information using PChar or ShortString parameters. }
