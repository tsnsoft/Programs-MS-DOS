THE NEW CAMPAIGNS
The new Beyond the Dark Portal campaigns
require the Expansion CD.  The CD is required
to be in the drive while playing the 
campaign levels.  If you wish to go back and
play the original Warcraft II campaign levels,
you will need to insert the original 
Warcraft II CD. 


NEW SOUND EFFECTS FILE
Beyond the Dark Portal will replace your
current sound effects with a new set,
including speech for the characters
and heroes you will encounter playing the
new campaigns.  If you have modified your 
sound effects, you should create a backup
copy of sfxdat.sud in your DATA directory
before installing the expansion.  After
you have installed, you can either 
modify the sounds using the sound effects
editor, or replace the new sfxdat.sud
file with your older one.  Please note that
if you use your older sfxdat.sud file, you
will not hear any of the new sounds that
we have added for the expansion.


MINIMAP OPTIONS
The TAB key toggles the minimap between two
different views during gameplay.  These views
are the standard view which reveals known
terrain and units, and unit view which shows
units only, with no terrain.  The unit view is
especially useful for tracking down units on
a map that are difficult to find.

CAPTURING SCREEN SHOTS
The Print Scrn key allows the user to take
screen captures at any time.  These will be
stored in PCX format in your Warcraft 2
directory.  If this does not work under Win95,
try using CTRL-ALT-Backquote(') instead.


RESETTING GAME DISPLAY & KEYS
The Scroll Lock key will reset the display if
it becomes corrupted, which can occur when
switching between applications in Windows.
If the keyboard hot-keys seem to stop responding,
press the backslash (\) key to reset the keyboard.

SCORING CLARIFICATIONS
The unit and kill counts on the score screens
may not always match up.  This can happen in 
the buildings and razings score where you 
receive credit for destroying a partially 
built structure, but your opponent will not 
receive credit for building it.



USAGE OF WALLS
Walls cannot be placed in single player games.
Walls may be used in multiplayer games that have
at least two human participants.

USAGE OF SPELLS
Spells such as raise dead, bloodlust or healing
only affect units that are organic in nature.
These types of spells will not affect units
such as ships, catapults or flying machines.

Haste increases the speed of a unit to the
equivalent of a Knight.  If haste is cast on a
Knight or faster unit, no change in speed
will occur.


Bombers and Sappers are unstable due to the
dangerous charges they carry.  Casting Unholy
Armor or Invisibility on them will set off
their explosives and kill them.

Bloodlust increases the speed of a unit and
increases the amount of damage done per attack.

Death Coil will drain life from any organic 
enemy unit within the area that the spell is 
cast and adds that life to the caster's.

MANUAL ERRATA
There is no manual based copy protection in
WarCraft 2.  To play single player games,
you will need to have the Warcraft CD in the
drive.  You may install a spawned copy onto
another system and that person can play in
multiplayer games against a player with the
Warcraft CD.  You can play with up to 3 people
with 1 CD, 6 people with 2 CD's, and 8 people
with 3 CD's.

There is only one install type as opposed to 
the three install types listed in the manual.

MAP & SOUND EDITOR
The Map and Sound Editor that is included with
Warcraft 2 is a Windows application.  If you
are using Windows 3.1x, you will need to 
have installed both Win32S and WinG.  If you 
have not installed these add-ons to Windows, 
you can download them from several Microsoft 
sites which are listed when you attempt to run 
the Map Builder in Windows.  If you are using 
Windows 95, there is no need to install these 
additional files.

When you are using the Map Builder to create
custom maps, they will be saved as .PUD
files.  These .PUD files must be saved in your
Warcraft 2 directory to be accessed.  For tips
on creating your own .PUD files, check the
Help section in the Map Builder.


PLAYING OVER THE INTERNET
KALI is a utility which simulates an IPX 
network for multiplayer games over the 
Internet.  The unregistered shareware version
of KALI is provided in the subdirectory KALI.

Please note the following:
- KALI runs only under DOS, it does not
  support Windows 95.
- KALI requires a direct connection to the 
  Internet or a SLIP/PPP connection.
- The unregistered version of KALI will allow
  a maximum of 15 minutes of gameplay.  It
  can be registered using the order form
  provided in the file KALI\ORDER.FRM.
- KALI is not a Blizzard product, and we are
  unable to provide support for it.

The following Web and FTP sites are the
official KALI sites:

     http://www.axxis.com/kali
     http://www.kali.net/   (online soon...)

     ftp://ftp.kali.net/pub/kali/
     ftp://ftp.axxis.com/pub/kali/

A Win95 version of KALI is almost
completed and will be available at the
above sites.

For more information about KALI, contact 
its author, Jay Cotton (jay@kali.net).


WAR2KALI.EXE is a patch that improves the 
performance of Warcraft II when played over KALI.
It is not necessary or desirable to use this 
patch when playing over a real IPX network or 
over a modem.

To use this patch: when starting a new 
KALI game, run WAR2KALI instead of WAR2.  
All players in the game should use this 
patch.

This patch is provided as a free service 
to Internet users.  It is not a supported 
product.  Please do not contact Blizzard 
Technical Support about this patch.  Any 
questions or comments regarding this patch 
may be mailed to "kali@blizzard.com".

WARCRAFT PATCH INFORMATION
This version of WarCraft 2 contains fixes
to certain features that were not included,
or did not work properly in the original
release of the game.  In the multiplayer
chat room, all players using "patched" 
versions of the game will have a Patch 
Icon next to the CD Icon.  It is still
possible to play against older versions
of WarCraft II, but any new fixes that
would be incompatible (like the Color 
Randomize Feature) will be disabled.

    Some of the new changes are:

EXCORSISM SPELL - In the original version
there were problems casting this spell
near the top of the map.  This has been
fixed.

COLOR RANDOMIZATION - In multiplayer games, 
team colors are now randomized in addition
to the starting locations.  All players must
be using v1.2 or higher for the randomization 
to be enabled.

VERSION DISPLAY IN CHATROOM - We have 
added a version number display in the 
chatroom.  As long as the game is created
by a v1.2 or higher version of Warcraft II,
the version number displayed for each user
will be accurate.  A v1.2 player joining a 
game will always have accurate information 
about the creator of the game, however, 
if the game creator is using a version 
prior to 1.2, those players who join after 
you will appear to you as as version 1.0, 
when in reality they may be playing with 
a more recent version.

REVISION HISTORY
v1.0 - Initial Release
v1.1 - Excorcism Spell Fix
       Fixed System Specific problems
       Included WAR2KALI and shareware KALI
       Attempt to randomize team colors
v1.2 - Fixed team color randomization
       Optimized IPX network code 
        (should increase performance over KALI)
       Fixed error when there are 255 or more
        .pud's in the War2 directory.
       Added version information to chatroom.
v1.3 - Beyond the Dark Portal Expansion.
      


TROUBLESHOOTING
If you are having problems running under 
Windows 95, please shut down to DOS and then 
run Warcraft II from there.  To do this, 
press the start button, select "Shut Down"
and then select "Restart in DOS Mode".
If you are running in Windows NT and the mouse
is caged to the top left of the screen, set
the vidmouse=0 line in your WAR2.INI file to 
vidmouse=2.

If you are using an Ensoniq Soundscape and
are experiencing sound degradation, use the 
Warcraft 2 setup program to set the digital
sound configuration to SoundBlaster.


Modem Init Strings
For best performance you will want to disable
compression and error control on your modem.
Here are some init strings for popular modems
that we have found to work well.

MOST HAYES COMPATIBLES:
    AT &K0 M1 S46=0 &D2 &Q6

US ROBOTICS SPORTSTER:
    CLEAR string set to:AT &F0
    AT &K0 M1 &M0 &D2

INTEL 14.4:
    AT &F\N0\Q0

2400 BAUD MODEMS:
    CLEAR and INIT strings set to ATZ

If your system does not run smoothly during
MODEM or DIRECT LINK play and you are using 
MIDI music, turn music OFF to increase game 
speed.  This is done by setting your MIDI 
Music Volume to 0, or by using the alt-m 
keystroke shortcut.

If your CD-ROM drive does not support Redbook
Audio or is not connected properly, uncheck the
"Enable CD Audio" selection box in the sound 
options dialog.  This will cause the game to 
now play MIDI music.
