     Some like it hot
     Some like it cold
     Some like it in the pot
     9 days old

       Daddy likes it hot
       Mummy likes it cold
       I like it in the pot
       9 days old.


    Say say you play made
    Come out and play with me
    And bring your (       )
    Climb up my apple tree
    Cry down my rainbell
    Slide down my sally door
    And we'll be jolly friends
     For ever more.


           Hambone
           ------

   Hambone, Hambone
   Have you heard
   Papa's gonna buy me
           a mocking bird?
   If the mocking bird don't sing
   Papa's gonna buy me a dimond ring.
   If the dimond rig don't shine
   Papa's gonna buy me a fishing line.
   Hambone, Hambone,
   Where have you been
   Round the world
   And I'm going again.
   Hambone, Hambone,
   Where's your wife?
   In the kitchen ccoking rise.


  Miss Mary Mack
  All dressed in Black
  With silver buttons
  ll down her back
  She asked her mother
  For fifteen cents
  To see the elephant
  Jump over the fence
  He jumped so high
  He reached the sky
  And didn't come back
  Till the forth of July.
