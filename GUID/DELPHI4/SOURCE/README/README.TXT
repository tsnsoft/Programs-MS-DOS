README.TXT
Ugly Duckling Software
January 32, 2001

This is a sample readme file. Read it to learn 
absolutely nothing about nothing.

There are no notes in this file, nor are there any 
version numbers or updates to announce. There's no 
number to call in case you have trouble. We have 
no address.

I hope you will enjoy the completely useless product 
described here. Actually, we don't have any products,
but never mind.

Okay, enough silliness. Get back to work!

Regards,

Tom Duck,
Chief Quacker,
Ugly Duckling Software
