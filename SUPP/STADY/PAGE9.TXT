        I'm a little utch girl dressed in blue
        And these are the things I like to do
        Salut to the captain; Bow to the queen
        And turn my back to the submarine

                    *  *  *

                 I love coffee, I love tea.
                 I want Mary to come in with me
            I love coffee I love tea
            I want Billy to come in with me.

                   -----------------

        Down in the valley where the green grass grows.
        There sat Susie as pretty as rose
        She sang she sang she sang so sweat.
        Along came Johnny and kissed her on the cheek
        How many kisses did she get?
        1, 2, 3 ...

        Feddy Bear (2) turn around
                   touch the ground
                   show your shoe
                   that will do
                   go upstairs
                   say your prayers
                   switch off the light
                   say' "Good night".

        Hit his head against the gate
        The gate through in
        The gate through out
        That's how he puts the fire out.
        o-u-t spells "out"
        and out you go.

        One-two sky blue
        All out but you
        One-two sky blue
        All in but you.
