  Little boxes on the hillside, little boxes made ofticky tacky.
  Little boxes, little boxes, little boxes all the same.
  Ther'e's a green one, then a pink one and a blue one and a yellow one,
  And they're all made out of ticky tacky and they all look just the same.

  And the people in the houses all go to the university
  And they all get put in boxes, little boxes, all the same.
  And there's doctors and there's lawyers and business executives
  And they're all made out of ticky tacky and they all look just the same.

  And they all play on the golfcourse and drink their Martini dry
  And they all have pretty children and the children go to schoo1.
  And the children go to summer camp and then to the university
  And they all get put in boxes and they all come out the same.

  And the boys go into business and marry and raise a family
  And they all get put in boxes, little boxes, all the same.
  Ther'e's a gt'een one, then a pink one and a blue one and a yellow one,
  And they're all made out of ticky tacky and they all look just the same.
