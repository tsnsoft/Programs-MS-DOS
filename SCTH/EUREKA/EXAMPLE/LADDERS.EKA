; This example demonstrates how Eureka can solve
; a system of nonlinear equations iteratively, after
; you initialize the iteration.

; System of non-linear equations:

x^2 + a^2 = 45^2
x^2 + b^2 = 35^2
y/10 = x/b
(x-y)/10 = x/a

;Initializations:

x:= 10
y := 10
a :=20
b:=20

; Constraints

a>0
b>0
x>0
x>y
y>0

; Exact solutions are:  x = 31.817459, y = 21.819934
; and a = 31.822151, b = 14.582500
