          Lucy
          ---

  Lucy had a baby, his name was Tiny-Tim
  She put him in the bath tub to see íf he could swim.
  He drank up all the water
  He ate up all the soap
  He tried to eat the bathtub
  But it wouldn't go down his throat
  Miss Lucy called the nurse
  Miss Lucy called the lady with the alegator purse.

  Mom, said the doctor
      said the nurse
  Nothing said the lady with the alegator purse.
  Miss Lucy punched the doctor
  Miss Lucy napped the nurse
  Paid the lady with the alegator
                      purse.

  Polly put the kettle on
  And have a cup of tea
  In comes Chainy
  And out goes me

  Don't you dear be late

  How many boys think I'm nice.

  Down by the ocean, down by the sea
  Johnny broke a bubble and
  Blamed it all on me.
  I told Ma; Ma told Pa
  Johnny got a spanking so Ha Ha Ha
  How many spankings did he get.

  Miss, Miss, pretty, little Miss,
  when you Miss, you miss like this.


  Engine, Engine number 9
  Yoing down Chicago line
  See it sparkle, see it shine
  Engine, Engine number 9.
  If the train should jump the track,
  Will I get my money back?
  Yes! No! May be so.
